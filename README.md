### Description
I had to build to create an existing website from scratch.

###Challenges

So I struggled to extend the widths for the footer and the forms. I tried editing each class in the css but still didn't manage to make any progress so I started working on the grid background, as it was blue. However, as I was focusing on one part of the website, I wasted a lot of time and ended up rushing. I was also confused about the homework as I though everything had to be identical, including the colour. 

###Takeaways
 Overall I was slightly frustrated as I couldnt get certain things right for instance, the forms width.

###Code block

``` html
<footer>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-offset-5 col-md-2 col-md-offset-5">
                <div class="text-center divBackground">
                    <div>
                        <p>Icon 1</p>
                        <p>Icon 2</p>
                    </div>
                    <a href="#">Support</a>
                    <p>&copy 2018 Volume. All Rights Reserved.</p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </footer>
```
I struggled with extending the width for footer.

```css
body {
    min-height: 100%;
    overflow: auto;
    color: #ffffff;
    font-family: Lato-Regular,Verdana,Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;
    font-size: 16px;
}
```
This will change everything in the body, including background colour and font.
